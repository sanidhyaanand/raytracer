# Raytracer
This is a raytracer written in c++. As of now it only renders compiled static files (images).<br>
## Installation and building
* To build in root directory
		
		make
    
* To generate ppm image file 

		make test
    
* Lastly, open image file with image loading softwares (like Photoshop or GIMP) or an online ppm viewer
    
(blah blah ppm more like poor primitive muck yes I know alright? I will look at implementing with modern <br>
packages and libraries later, getting basic rendering functionality down with raytracing for now)
